# Using pkgsrc on Solaris 10 SPARC in 2024

I am trying to collect all ideas/hacks I used to build software using pkgsrc on Solaris 10 SPARC.
The process is in progress. I am happy to get comments, ideas and exchange the experience: mercurius(@)elming.org

This page will be updated when I get new results.

## TL;DR
 
More or less, it’s successful. I am pleasantly surprised.
There’s Python 3.12, OpenSSL 3.3.1 and a lot of modern software working on Solaris 10 SPARC!

I use gcc 5.5 from OpenCSW. I installed Sun Studio 12.3 but I wasn't successful in building anything in the pkgsrc tree, but most of the packages need gcc.
Also, I built gcc 9.5 from source, see [GCC 9](#gcc-9).

## Why Solaris 10?

I have Sun Ultra 60 and Sun Blade 100, Solaris 11 cannot be installed on them.
OpenIndiana can, but it needs zfs and both of them don't have enough RAM.
There's also another illumos-based system called Tribblix (tribblix.org), it looks nice but I decided to try on the original Sun Solaris 10 (01/13, the latest one).

I don't have access to original Oracle repositories for patches and updates. Then I have the system how it comes from the DVD.

## The process

pkgsrc HOWTO is here: [https://wiki.netbsd.org/pkgsrc/how_to_use_pkgsrc_on_solaris/](https://wiki.netbsd.org/pkgsrc/how_to_use_pkgsrc_on_solaris/)
There's a wiki page from 2007, it's old but can be useful: [https://wtf.hijacked.us/wiki/index.php/Pkgsrc_on_solaris](https://wtf.hijacked.us/wiki/index.php/Pkgsrc_on_solaris)

I had to take pkgsrc 2024Q2 because 2024Q3 has Perl 5.40, which I couldn't build on Solaris.
there was an issue in Github [https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22728](https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/22728) – it’s closed, then maybe I'll give it a try again later.

sunfreeware.com is not available anymore (at least, for free), then I am using gcc5 and other utilities (mentioned in the HOWTO) from [https://www.opencsw.org/](https://www.opencsw.org/)
Also, I had to install sqlite3. Then, bootstrap and go on!

My mk.conf is here: [http://lizaurus.com/solaris10/pkgsrc-solaris10/bootstrap/mk.conf](http://lizaurus.com/solaris10/pkgsrc-solaris10/bootstrap/mk.conf)

## If something is failing

It’s tricky sometimes with binutils (like as, ar, ld).
Solaris has their own in /usr/ccs/bin and there are GNU binutils from OpenCSW, also, another version of GNU binutils can be installed using pkgsrc itself.
I am trying to use GNU binutils as much as possible, but sometimes something is failing. Then:
- use environment variables like AR, AS, LD and try another utility
- if the build process catches a wrong utility, create a symlink / adjust paths
- if there's an error, in most cases Google knows the answer
- in some cases, adding environment variables (CFLAGS, LDFLAGS or even LD_LIBRARY_PATH) helps
- try to use libsol10-compat (see below)
- ...or you have to patch the code. In some cases, the compiler suggested me which definitions you need to use.

## Solaris 10 compat library

Something is failing because Solaris is specific and doesn't have something which is available in other UNIX systems (constant definitions, header files, etc.).
And there's Solaris 10 compat library, big thanks to Pekdon for this: [https://github.com/pekdon/libsol10-compat/](https://github.com/pekdon/libsol10-compat/)

It has pkgsrc-compatible stuff to make a package... let's use it

```bash
export TMPDIR=/stuff/tmp # or another tmpdir/homedir/...
export PKGSRC=/stuff/pkgsrc # pkgsrc root directory, usually /usr/pkgsrc
cd $TMPDIR
git clone https://github.com/pekdon/libsol10-compat.git
cd libsol10-compat/pkgsrc
gcp -pruv libsol10-compat/ ${PKGSRC}/devel/ # I use GNU cp, Solaris cp -r will also work
cd ../..
```

then, the repo directory must to be renamed to libsol10-compat-0.1.0 and then packed to the archive:

(we are in $TMPDIR)

```bash
mv libsol10-compat libsol10-compat-0.1.0
bsdtar cvzf ${PKGSRC}/distfiles/libsol10-compat-0.1.0.tar.gz libsol10-compat-0.1.0
cd ${PKGSRC}/devel/libsol10-compat/
bmake NO_CHECKSUM=yes
```

...bmake unpacks our archive, but then fails because we need to run autoreconf -i to have configure

```bash
cd ${PKGSRC}/devel/libsol10-compat/work/libsol10-compat-0.1.0
autoreconf -i
cd ../..
bmake NO_CHECKSUM=yes
bmake install
```

And yes! there's a package! Thank you again Pekdon!

### How to use it

It installs `libsol10_compat_patch_pkgsrc` which patches original pkgsrc files and takes two arguments:
- the list of packages to be patched (there's "packages" file in the repo, but you can create your own,
- the root directory of pkgsrc tree, e.g. /usr/pkgsrc (I use /stuff/pkgsrc)

There's a blog post about trying Solaris 10 as a desktop: [https://pekdon.pekwm.se/posts/solaris_desktop/](https://pekdon.pekwm.se/posts/solaris_desktop/) - very useful!

## Other issues I faced

Of course this list isn't full, feel free to ask me if you have a specific issue.

too many open files - Solaris has ulimit as usual, but it cannot be more than set in `/etc/system`. And if it's not set, the default is 256.
My settings are:

```bash
set rlim_fd_max=166384
set rlim_fd_cur=32768
```

after changing this file, you need to reboot!

**libuv**: patched tcp.c but linking libnbcompat fails, add `-fPIC` flag [https://gnats.netbsd.org/56668](https://gnats.netbsd.org/56668)

**rhash**: take newer version (1.4.5) from the next pkgsrc tarball (2024Q3), it builds successfully

**glib2**: I used libsol10-compat, but it still throws an error in 

```bash
[466/1428] Compiling C object glib/tests/getpwuid-preload.so.p/getpwuid-preload.c.o

```

This file just has different functions declarations, feel free to adjust them how they're declared in /usr/include/pwd.h and run bmake again.

**cmake**: needs -lncurses because it tries to link itself with Solaris curses library + new gcc

I removed two files connected to GHS (they caused error about gbuild but Green Hills software is not common for Solaris), also bmake package SSP_SUPPORTED=no (but I think it can be solved by another way, for example symlinking /usr/local/lib/sparcv9/libssp.so to /usr/pkg/lib).

How long did it take to build cmake? Here it is:

```bash
real    786m29.379s
user    708m1.986s
sys     44m31.926s
```

it's built with new gcc and needs libs from the archive (see [GCC 9](#gcc-9) (gcc5 could't build it)

pango: ?

Who else helped me? ChatGPT. sometimes it provides too much information, but usually I brought my errors to it and it could help where to look/patch/fix/etc.

## Getting new certificates:

Even if openssl is installed, it cannot check certificates because there're no root certificates in the system. 
I reminded that I had ca-certificates in Linux. ca-certificates needs py-cryptography which needs rust, and rust isn't available for Solaris-SPARC (yet).

But, ca-certificates is just a script which updates existing certificates. If we don't have any, it doesn't do anything.

It's necessary to install security/mozilla-rootcerts-openssl to get certificates. They will be stored in /usr/pkg/etc/openssl/certs.

## The result

The packages I have successfully built already: [http://lizaurus.com/solaris10/pkgsrc-solaris10/](http://lizaurus.com/solaris10/pkgsrc-solaris10/)
Almost all of them have been built by gcc5 from OpenCSW and some tools need its libgcc_s. 

Packages built by gcc9 (see below) are in a subfolder (cmake, graphite, harfbuzz).

After the bootstrap, there's pkg_install utility and those packages can be just installed without rebuilding. My bootstrap is also there: [http://lizaurus.com/solaris10/pkgsrc-solaris10/bootstrap](http://lizaurus.com/solaris10/pkgsrc-solaris10/bootstrap)

To make life simpler, I configure my PATH to look in /usr/pkg first:
`PATH=/usr/pkg/bin:/opt/csw/bin:/usr/sfw/bin:/usr/bin:`

and for root:
`PATH=/usr/pkg/sbin:/opt/csw/sbin:/usr/sfw/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/pkg/bin:/opt/csw/bin:/usr/sfw/bin:/usr/bin:`

## The system python

Better to have `python3` and `python` symlinked to /usr/pkg/bin/python. There's /usr/sfw/bin/python coming with Solaris, it's version 2.3.3. Quite old, eh?

## GCC 9

I wasn't able to build the package (`devel/gcc9`), but I was able to built it just from source. It took ca. 2 days to build it on my Sun Blade 100.

```bash
-bash-3.2# /usr/local/bin/gcc9.5 -v
Using built-in specs.
COLLECT_GCC=/usr/local/bin/gcc9.5
COLLECT_LTO_WRAPPER=/usr/local/libexec/gcc/sparcv9-sun-solaris2.10/9.5.0/lto-wrapper
Target: sparcv9-sun-solaris2.10
Configured with: /stuff/tmp/gcc-9.5.0/configure --program-suffix=9.5 --enable-languages=c,c++ -v --enable-obsolete --enable-ld=yes
Thread model: posix
gcc version 9.5.0 (GCC)
```

gcc 9.5 to be installed in /usr/local : [http://lizaurus.com/solaris10/gcc](http://lizaurus.com/solaris10/gcc)

I used Solaris as (/usr/ccs/bin/as) and ld (/usr/ccs/bin/ld), also --enable-obsolete because gcc 9.5 is the last version supporting Solaris 10.

The next step is to try to build gcc9 in the pkgsrc using this gcc9! Then, we'll have a package which can be installed without any hacks, and re-build those packages which need newer gcc "by a proper way".
