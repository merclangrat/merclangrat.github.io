## Welcome! Tervetuloa! Добро пожаловать!

The website is under construction, but you can visit [my blog at Wordpress](https://merclangrat.wordpress.com) about retro computers.

You can contact me (Russian/English/Ukrainian):
- WhatsApp/Telegram: **+49-170-475-8557** 
- Email ***mercurius(@)elming.org***

**I do not speak German**. If you write to me in German, I can only read and answer using Google Translate/DeepL (or in English)  
But it's better not to do so, it makes me nervous and uncomfortable. Write in English, please.

**I do NOT like Mac OS X** (I don't call it anything else because, for me, MacOS is a Classic one). Mac OS X looks like putting a square peg into a round hole. Then, I am not the best person to ask about building software/troubleshooting anything on it.  
And of course, I am against current Apple politics.

In my everyday life, I use [Devuan Linux](https://devuan.org) - a systemd-free Linux distro.
