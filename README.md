**I do not speak German**. If you write to me in German, I can only read and answer using Google Translate/DeepL (or in English)  
But it's better not to do so, it makes me nervous and uncomfortable. Write in English, please.

**I do NOT like Mac OS X** (I don't call it anything else because, for me, MacOS is a Classic one). Mac OS X looks like putting a square peg into a round hole. Then, I am not the best person to ask about building software/troubleshooting anything on it.  
And of course, I am against current Apple politics.

In my everyday life, I use [Devuan Linux](https://devuan.org) - a systemd-free Linux distro.

Also, I spend some time on using **pkgsrc on Solaris 10 SPARC**. Solaris is my "favourite" UNIX since 2000s, I have [a blog post with the story](https://merclangrat.wordpress.com/2024/12/15/solaris-twenty-years-after/).  
This is the page about my progress: [pkgsrc on Solaris 10 SPARC in 2024](/pkgsrc-solaris10). Feel free to contact me to exchange the experience!  
If writing emails isn't the best way for you, just comment in my blog.

And, because I am from the USSR, my big interest is **Soviet computers**, especially PDP-11 compatible.
